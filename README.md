## Introduction
Skylink is a real-time flight chatroom with in-flight offline messaging designed to enhance the passenger experience by enabling seamless communication before, during, and after flights.

## Problem Statement
Air travel can often feel isolating, and passengers may want to connect with fellow travelers for discussions, networking, or sharing flight-related updates. Skylink aims to create a chatroom system where passengers can interact 48 hours before departure and up to 6 hours after arrival, while also enabling offline messaging during the flight.

## Solution
Skylink addresses these challenges by providing:
- A real-time chatroom accessible 48 hours before departure and 6 hours post-arrival.
- AI-moderated chat to ensure a safe and respectful environment.
- Peer-to-peer offline messaging to enable in-flight communication without an internet connection.
- Integration with real-time flight updates for passengers.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Chatroom:** Connect with co-passengers before, during, and after the flight.
- **Offline Messaging:** Messages are stored and delivered once online.
- **AI Moderation:** Detects and filters spam, offensive content, and hate speech.
- **Privacy-First Approach:** Nickname-based entry system to ensure anonymity.
- **Flight Updates Integration:** Receive real-time flight status notifications.
